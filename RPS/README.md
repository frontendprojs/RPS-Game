    * here's how it works! *


- choose your options from cards section, by the time when you touch anything from that three options, the selected one will print on the dark circle named "you chose" and also in the opponent circle, the computer will choose a random card!
- i've written an function which will check the game rules like, if you choose rock and the opponent chose paper, you will get a point.
- if you got the point or lose or tie whatever, you'll get the message on the blue color section
- if the point showing section's textContent is 'win' then you will get a point or its 'lose' then it will probably increase the opponents point! its all about increament.
- there is a button named 'reset' which will reset the whole game and start again!, the working behind that button is quite complicated to explain, feel free to check, i used dispatchevent for the magic to work lol!
- ok finally by the time when you or the opponent hits 20 points there will be confirm box which will tell who first hits 20 points and won the game
- also in that confirm box, it will ask if you want to reset the game and start again!, so if you press ok then it will reset by using the dispatch event thing or if you press cancel then it will still continue!
-for responsive web, i used bootsrap 4 framework in this!
